CLASS -  creates a new TYPE where OBJECTS are INSTANCES of the CLASS.
Vars are referred to as FIELDS.
FIELDS and METHODS can be referred to as ATTRIBUTES of the class.

Fields are of two types - they can belong to each instance/object of the class or they can
belong to the class itself.
They are called "instance variables" and "class variables" respectively.

---------------------SELF-------------
Class methods hace only one specific difference form ordingary fuctinos- they must hace an
extrda first name that has to be added th the beginning of the PARAMETER when you call the
METHOD , Python will provide it. this particular var refers to teh OBJECT ITSELF
and by convention it is given the name SELF-n

Note for C++/Java/C# Programmers

The self in Python is equivalent to the this pointer in C++ and the this reference in Java and C#.

even a method without args stil has one - SELF.
